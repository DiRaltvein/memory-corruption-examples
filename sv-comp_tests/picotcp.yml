    # TODO: test idea is that pico_frame_discard is called 2 times where 2 call uses already freed pointer (pointer is freed but not NULL)
    # Overall 2 memory violations occur, 1 is when f->proto is accessed that is invalid pointer dereference and another is when f->proto or f are freed that is double free.
    # As there is 2 memory violations probably is would make sense to check only for the parent classification that is valid-memsafety.prp
