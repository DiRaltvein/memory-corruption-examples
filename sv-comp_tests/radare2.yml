    # TODO: test idea is that free_object is called 2 times where 2 call uses already freed pointer (pointer is freed but not NULL)
    # Overall 2 memory violations occur, 1 is when object->data is accessed that is invalid pointer dereference and another is when object->data or object are freed that is double free.
    # As there is 2 memory violations probably is would make sense to check only for the parent classification that is valid-memsafety.prp
